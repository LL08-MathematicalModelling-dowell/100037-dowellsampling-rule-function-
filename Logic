Call dowellsampling rules(sample size,number of categories)									
									
	Define sample size as variable "n"								
		Input from frontend programmer or user / Call dowellsamplesize()							
	Define number of categories as variable "k"								
		Input from frontend programmer or user 							
	 if the sample size is greater than equals to 30,it is appropriate								
	otherwise ,prompt " sample size is not adequate"								
	if there are more than one category or subset,								
		Minimum sample size  for each subset should be atleast 30							
		if not ,prompt " sample size is not adequate"							
	In case of multivariate research,								
		if sample size is greater or equals to 10 times the number of variables in the study,then accept and continue							
		if sample size is less than 10 times the number of variables in the study,then prompt" sample size is not adequate as per this condition"and continue with checking another conditions							
			if other conditions (mentioned above)are satisfied,then accept the sample size						
			if not,then prompt " sample size is not acceptable"						
									
	Function output(Acceptance of sample size,sample size)
